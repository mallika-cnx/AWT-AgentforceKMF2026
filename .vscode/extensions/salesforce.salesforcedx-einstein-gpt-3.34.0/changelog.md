# We’re Now Doing Pre Releases!

Do you like living on the edge and trying new features and bug fixes before our customers do? You know you do. You can help us by testing pre-release versions of Agentforce Vibes before they ship. It’s easy to do, doesn't cost a dime and you’ll help make Agentforce Vibes better for the entire developer community.

## Why use the pre-release?

You’ll get early access to new capabilities, improvements, and fixes. Plus, your feedback helps us catch issues and help us ship higher-quality releases.

## Versioning Scheme

**Pre Release**: Odd-numbered weekly releases (for example, v1.11)

**Stable Release**: Even-numbered weekly releases (for example, v1.10)

Features first appear in the Pre Release and roll into the Stable Release the following week.

- We added some spiffy syntax highlighting to responses so that the generated code block looks exactly like it would in your code editor.

## Fixed

- We made token usage optimal by estimating in advance how many tokens a prompt would use, while also increasing the token budget. Response truncation incidents are now greatly reduced as a result of these updates. And you’re no longer wasting those precious tokens. Win-win much?
- We fixed an issue with single line generations not wrapping around columns. Responses are now formatted correctly in the History & Feedback tab.
- We fixed some issues so that both engineered prompts and Apex code responses are better formatted.

# 0.27.1

## Added

- We made some changes under the hood.

# 0.26.3

## Added

- Einstein for Developers can now correctly parse custom metadata when it is a part of a prompt and uses the `__mdt` suffix. The metadata added to a prompt in this way is automatically included into the context to ground generations. Make sure to run `SFDX:Refresh SObject Definitions` to pull custom metadata from your org into the project. Then build prompts using the custom metadata and associated suffix. Enjoy building those cool prompts!
- We made some changes under the hood.

# 0.24.2

## Added

- You can now reference multiple custom objects in your prompt, making code generations more aware of your project's metadata. Run SFDX:Refresh SObjects Definitions to gather org metadata into your project. Then build your prompt using as many custom objects in the metadata as you want. Enjoy building those awesome prompts!
- You can now use the Esc key to clear code suggestions.

# 0.23.1

### Fixed

- We updated these keyboard shortcuts--
  - Use `ctrl+enter` / `cmd+enter` to accept a code suggestion that is generated in your Apex file when you run the `Einstein: Generate Code` command from that file.
  - Use `ctrl+shift+r` / `cmd+shift+r` to open the `Einstein: Generate Code` command in the command palette. You must have an Apex file in focus to use this shortcut.

- We increased the character limit for the text you can enter in the Einstein sidebar. Now you don’t have to worry about running out of words when you’re crafting your prompts. We know you have a lot of questions. Ask away!

# 0.22.1

## Fixed

- We also let you know when your CLI version needs updating.
- We fixed an issue where the feedback in the panel would get out of sync with feedback in the history. Thank you [Jeff Kranz](https://github.com/jkranz-rk) for reporting the [issue](https://github.com/forcedotcom/Einstein-GPT-for-Developers/issues/16).
- We made some changes under the hood.

## Added

- We made an update to telemetry reporting.

# 0.19.0 Open Beta Release

We released a brand new Einstein for Developers (Beta) extension. This extension used with the Salesforce Extension Pack, powers up your Salesforce development environment with custom generative AI. Use the extension to generate boilerplate Apex code from natural language instructions in a sidebar, so you can work with your editor and the tool side by side, without any interruptions to your workflow.

# 0.1.0 - 0.18.0

These releases were limited to the Einstein for Developers closed pilot.
